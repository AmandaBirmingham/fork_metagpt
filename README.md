# OpenAI Jupyter Notebook Wrapper

A simple and intuitive wrapper that allows users to easily interact with the OpenAI API directly within Jupyter Notebooks. This wrapper simplifies the process of querying the OpenAI models and makes it more accessible for researchers, developers, and data scientists working in a notebook environment.

## Key Features

- ü§ù **Seamless Integration**: Designed specifically for Jupyter Notebooks, ensuring a smooth user experience.
- üó£ **Simplified API Calls**: Reduces boilerplate code, making it easier to query OpenAI models.
- üí• **Customizable**: Provides flexibility to fine-tune parameters for your specific needs.
- üö® **Error Handling**: Built-in error handling for common OpenAI API issues.

## Requirements

This package requires the following dependencies:

- `pandas` - For data handling and manipulation.
- `numpy` - For numerical operations.
- `openai` - Official OpenAI Python client.

## Installation

To use this wrapper, clone the repository and install it directly from GitHub:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/dpear/metagpt.git
```
