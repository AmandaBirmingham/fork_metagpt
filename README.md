# OpenAI Jupyter Notebook Wrapper

AutoMetaD (Processing MetaData Automatically) is an LLM-based tool presented in the form of a jupyter notebook that allows users to easily clean and summarize metadata with support for attributes commonly relevant to microbiome studies. Users can interact with an LLM within a jupyter notebook in ways that automatically provide context to queries based on the loaded metadata file. Summarizing a table and visualizing columns and intersections of columns have been automated, along with specific functions for anomaly detection and column name correcting. 


## Installation

To use this notebook, clone the repository and create a new conda environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dpear/metagpt.git
cd metagpt
conda create env -n metagpt -f environment.yml
```

If you wish to use within an existing conda environment:
```bash
conda env update --name existing_env --file environment.yml
```

Then, activate the environment to add a jupyter notebook kernel:
```bash
conda activate metagpt
python -m ipykernel install --user --name metagpt --display-name "metagpt"
```

## Using the Notebook

First activate the environment, then actiate the jupyter notebook server (please note that you must activate the environment before starting the jupyter notebook server):
```bash
conda activate metagpt
jupyter notebook
```
Then navigate to the `proof_of_concept_template_ai_memorializing_DP.ipynb` notebook and run to see an example of the different supported summarization and cleaning functions.
