# LMNOP

LMNOP (LLM-based Microbial Metadata Notebook Processing) is a tool presented in the form of a jupyter notebook that allows users to easily clean and summarize metadata fields with support for attributes commonly relevant to microbiome studies, such as summary statistics and visualizations. Users can directly query an LLM within a jupyter notebook in ways that automatically provide context to queries based on the loaded metadata file. With automated improved prompt engineering, obtaining and running code suggestions from ChatGPT. The notebook also provides functions for anomaly detection and column name correcting are presented. Voice recognition is also supported through OpenAI's extremely accurate whisper voice transcription library.


## Installation

To use this notebook, clone the repository and create a new conda environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dpear/metagpt.git
cd metagpt
conda env create -n metagpt -f environment.yml
```

If you wish to use within an existing conda environment:
```bash
conda env update --name existing_env_name --file environment.yml
```

Then, activate the environment to add a jupyter notebook kernel:
```bash
conda activate metagpt
python -m ipykernel install --user --name lmnop --display-name "Python (lmnop jupyter kernel)"
```

## Using the Notebook

First activate the environment, then actiate the jupyter notebook server (please note that you must activate the environment before starting the jupyter notebook server):
```bash
conda activate lmnop
jupyter notebook
```
Then navigate to the `proof_of_concept_template_ai_memorializing_DP.ipynb` notebook and run to see an example of the different supported summarization and cleaning functions.
